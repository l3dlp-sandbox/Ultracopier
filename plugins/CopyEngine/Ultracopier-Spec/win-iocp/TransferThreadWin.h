/** \file TransferThreadWin.h
\brief Windows IOCP backend for the pipelined file transfer (Windows only)
\author alpha_one_x86
\licence GPL3, see the file COPYING

Implements only the I/O hooks of TransferThreadPipelined with a Windows I/O completion
port and overlapped ReadFile/WriteFile; all transfer logic lives in the shared base
class. Compiled only when ULTRACOPIER_PLUGIN_WINIOCP is defined; otherwise the translation unit is
empty and cannot affect the existing backends. */

// The IOCP backend uses GetQueuedCompletionStatusEx()/CancelIoEx() — Windows Vista+ APIs
// absent on Windows XP. ULTRACOPIER_PLUGIN_WINIOCP is defined ONLY for Qt6 (Windows 10+)
// builds by ultracopier.pro / CopyEngine.pro (win32:greaterThan(QT_MAJOR_VERSION,5)); on
// Qt5 / Windows XP / pre-Vista the define is absent, so the .pro selects the async
// (thread-based) backend instead and this whole file compiles to nothing. No #error: the
// build gracefully falls back rather than failing (and stays mingw 4.9.x compatible).
